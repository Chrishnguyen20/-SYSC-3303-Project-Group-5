Documentation:
- Class Diagram:  a UML class representation of the program 
- Sequence Diagram: a UML representation of a single program loop. That is, the floor sends a floor request to the scheduler, the scheduler relays the information to the elevator, the elevator picks up the passengers, then the elevator takes the passengers to their destination floor.

Instructions:
The program's usage is fairly straightforward, however, requires the use of the Eclipse IDE. Simply unzip the source file, open the project in Eclipse, then press run. All the output is printed to the console for easy reading.

Breakdown or responsibilities: 
- Billal: worked on the Floor and FloorRequest classes
- Minh:   worked on Scheduler, ElevatorRequest, and FloorRequest classes
- Leo:    worked on Elevator and ElevatorRequest classes
