Documentation:
- Class Diagram:  a UML class representation of the program 
- Sequence Diagram: a UML representation of a single program loop. That is, the floor sends a floor request to the scheduler, the scheduler relays the information to the elevator, the elevator picks up the passengers, then the elevator takes the passengers to their destination floor.

Instructions:
The program's usage is fairly straightforward, however, requires the use of the Eclipse IDE. Simply unzip the source file, open the project in Eclipse, then press run. All the output is printed to the console for easy reading.

Distance between floor is 4 meters.
Average time it takes per floor: 9.5 seconds
Average time from floor 1-7: 19.825 seconds
Speed per floor: 4/9.5 = 0.42105 m/s
Speed from floor 1-7: 28/19.825 = 1.412358 m/s
Rate of acceleration per floor: 0.42105/9.5 = 0.04432 m/s^2  
Rate of acceleration floor 1-7: 1.412358/19.825 = 0.07124 m/s^2 
Average loading/unloading time per floor: 9.51428 seconds
Average loading/unloading time from floor 1-7: 9.175 seconds
